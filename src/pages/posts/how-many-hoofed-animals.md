As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, there are over 250 species of hoofed animals, also known as ungulates, found worldwide. These include both wild and domesticated species. Some examples of hoofed animals include horses, cows, deer, sheep, pigs, giraffes, elephants, and hippos, among others. Hoofed animals are characterized by having hooves, which are specialized, hard, and often cloven structures that serve as their primary means of support and movement. They are an important group of mammals that play crucial roles in ecosystems and are of great economic and cultural significance to human societies. Please note that the actual number of hoofed animal species may change over time as taxonomic classifications are refined and updated with new scientific discoveries.
