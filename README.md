# Hovofotgrafen

Hovofotgrafen is a showcase website, partially in Swedish, built with Astro.js, a modern front-end framework for building fast websites with Astro components. 
The site features a playful use of the Chart.js library to create a graph displaying the frequency of hoofs vs feet.

The inspiration for this website came from a misspelling of the Swedish word "hovfotograf" (court photographer) as "hovofotgraf" (which sort of sounds like "Hoof-and-Foot-graph".
